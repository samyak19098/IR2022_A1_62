various individuals.  It's a group effort and reflects a multitude of
experiences.  Its intended audience are the small press publishers in
the San Francisco/Bay Area.  Please take the information with a grain of
salt.  Many listing contain contradictory information because different
people have had different experiences dealing with the various

     If you feel the information on this list is unfair and inaccurate,
please contact me and I'll see if I can straighten things out.  This
information is correlated for the zine publisher, so it's written from
that point of view.

valuable as those in the area.  Feel free to send me any information
that is important to the National zine community.

RETAIL OUTLETS

A DIFFERENT LIGHT, 489 Castro Street, SF, CA
Queer, Porn, Music, Tatoos,
Rachel Pepper, (415) 431-0891 60/40 consignment.
Mostly queer but open to other strong minded works.  Heavy traffic and
pays fast.  Most don't have payment problems but many people with high
volume sometimes do.  Poetry and lit zines doesn't sell well especially
if not high in queer content.  Other stores in NY & LA have their own
managers and buyers, who prefer to deal directly with publisher.

AURICULAR RECORDS, 575 Haight St, SF, CA 94117
Music, Chaos, Weird, Art, Industrial,
(415) 626-7635

BOUND TOGETHER, 1369 Haight St, SF, CA
Anarchy, Fiction, Poetry, Politics, Queer, Marxism, Feminism,
(415) 431-8355 60/40 Consignment.
Not much traffic but a good outlet for more political things.  Needs a
sample copy for consideration at collective meeting.  Will then take if
no one objects.  Payment after 15th of the month, only in person, no
checks.  Many people shop here for small-press stuff and nowhere else.

CITY LIGHTS BOOKS, 261 Columbus Ave, SF, CA
Poetry, Fiction, Literature, Chapbooks, Art, Politics, Music, Anything,
Suzette Partido (415) 362-8193

Comix, Music, Sex,
Josh Petrin, zine buyer. Berkeley (510) 843-5002/SF (415) 552-9010
Mostly comics.  Only seem to carry macho white-boy sex, not very pro-
queer.  Berkeley branch has more traffic and only place in Berkeley to
sell zines.  "One of the best comic stores in the country."

DEVIANT BOOKS 473 Haight Street, SF, CA
Comix, Fiction, Poetry, Queer, Tatoos, Porn, Anything,
Bob Brown, owner, (415) 554-0360 60/40 consignment.
Is very enthusiastic but is sometimes short on cash.  Always best to
talk with Bob.  Will take just about anything on consignment.  Best if
you're have small press run.  Some people have been "ripped off" by Bob,
especially high volume publishers.  Always asks you to come back and
only pays in cash for those copies already sold.

Punk, Queer, Hard Core, Political, Anarchist,
Matt Smith, (415) 431-2725
Very enthusiastic about zines but not that much shelf space.  Punky
xerox looking stuff is OK.  Strong emphasis on music but also very
interested in anarchy/leftist stuff.  Sometimes pays upfront.  Has zine
library.  Good idea to donate a copy of your zine to their library.
People to hang out there and read the stuff. Weird hours, 3-8 weekdays,
12-7 weekends.

GOOD VIBRATIONS, 1210 Valencia, SF, CA
Sex, Lesbian, Queer, Comix, Porn, Fiction, Sexual Politics,

Video, Media, Weird, Pop, Comix, Queer,
Lisa Muncaster (415) 552-2900

(415) 282-9246
Collectively run bookstore.  Big on political stuff.  Lots of cool

Sometimes pays cash upfront.

SMALL PRESS TRAFFIC, 3599 24th St, SF, CA
Poetry, Fiction, Chapbooks, Journals, Criticism,
John McNally (415) 285-8394
Almost a graveyard with too many chapbooks.  Poetry, poetry, and more
poetry.  Not many sales but a good place to find some out of print
material.  A good place to shop but not so good to sell.  They say they
pay their accounts a couple of times a year - but don't count on it.
Being current helps.  Takes about 5 copies at a time.  Very few copies
tend to get sold.  Best to deal with them in person.  Not very hip.

TOWER BOOKS
Music, Queer, Fiction, Literature, Anything,
Sacramento, Doug Biggert, 2601 Del Monte St, W. Sacra, (916) 373-2561

sometimes 1 month to 6 months after receipt.  Sometimes pays fastest of

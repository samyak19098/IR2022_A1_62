                The Comic Strip Presents Episode Guide
               ========================================

Here is a listing of the short films shown under the general title
                   "The Comic Strip Presents"

Version 5.0 11/94
Additions/Corrections to: michaels@jake.chem.unsw.EDU.AU or
			  michaels@cumulus.csd.unsw.EDU.AU

As far as I can make out, this version of the guide has a complete listing of
all Comic Strips Presents episodes to date. Unless I have made major errors or
omissions (your feedback is appreciated), this should be the last version of
the guide until the next Comic Strip series is produced.

The Comic Strip gets its name from a Stage show/revue of the same name which
ran from Oct 1980 to July 1981 and starred the regulars that appear in the TV
Comic Strip films (Richardson, Sayle, Planer, Mayall, Edmondson, French and
Saunders among others).

Year          Title                      Writer

1982  Five go Mad in Dorsett             Richardson, Richens
		Spoof of the "Famous Five" childrens adventure books by Enid
		Blyton. Lots ham and turkey sandwiches, heaps of tomatoes,
		fresh lettuce and lashings of ginger beer.

		Anne: Look! Timmy's [the dog] fallen over.
		George: Oh Crikey, he's been poisoned!
		Julian: Never mind George, we'll get another.

1983  War                                Richardson, Richens
		Britain is invaded by the Russians - along with lot of really
		weird characters, like a US general who is really short on
		soldiering skills, mad mexican gunslingers, a special forces
		commando team who are all blind, and paratroops who think
		parachutes are for sissies. This episode is more a series
		of surreal vignettes based on standard war movie themes (eg
		a POW camp & escape committee) or scenes from particular
		war movies (eg Russian roulette from 'The Deer Hunter')

		Radio Announcer: OK, Right, uh we've just heard that the Warsaw
		                 Pact countries uh invaded Surrey at dawn this
                                 morning, so there may be delays on
                                 cross-channel ferries OK.

		Japanese Prison Camp Officer: My name is Kiri, - Harry Kiri!
		                              Ha ha old samuri joke.

		Donald/Miguel: They think that Miguel's just a stupid peasant.
		               They say, hahaha, Miguel's got flared trousers!
		               They say Miguel's got no CSEs!

1983  The Beat Generation                Richardson, Richens
		Sendup of trendy 1960's films. Filmed in B&W.

1983  Bad News Tour                      Edmondson
		A-la "This is Spinal Tap" Rockumentary.
		Follow Vim Fuego, Den Dennis, Colin Grigson and Spider Webb
		on tour as the heavy metal band 'Bad News'. (Well, not so much
		on tour, more like driving to the Roxy in Grantham for a
		gig.) It is a masterful tour-de-force of the cinema-verite
		documentary style.

		Vim: I could play 'Stairway to Heaven' when I was 12. Jimmy
		     Page didn't actually write it 'till he was 22. I think
		     that says quite a lot.

		Spider: [whisper] This is it. Just cry like I told you to or
			you won't get paid.
		Girl: Ohhhh Noooo Spider, don't leave me, not now.
		Spider: Chicks huh! See ya doll.
		Vim: [voice over] Spider used to have this really big drug
		     problem - you know, he couldn't get enough! That's
		     probably why he is like he is, you know, completely crazed.

		Vim: We'd be as rich as the Stones of we sold as many records
		     as them.
		Vim: Life on the road is a lot more interesting than working in
		     a factory. I mean you do a lot more driving for a start!

1983  Summer School                      French, Saunders
		Recreate everyday life in a paleolithic village as part of an
		anthropologist's research project while on your summer break
		from University.

		Nick: Beth, I want you to know that what you and I are about to
		      do is all in the course of duty. Yeah, like, we must take
		      on the responsibility of research, yeah?
		Beth: Yes, I do see what you mean, but there is a snag.
		Nick: What's that?
		Beth: I'm having my P. E. R. I. O. D. so I think we should
                      wait a few days. It's a bit mucky you know!
		Nick: Pernod ?

1983  Five go Mad on Mescalin            Richardson, Richens
		More Famous 5 adventures. It was to have been a pleasant summer
		holiday, but Uncle Quentin (the well known scientist and
		homosexual) has escaped from prison.

		Julian: [talking about a waitress] What a queer girl.
		Anne: I think she looks cheap.
		George: Yes, and mentally retarded.
		Julian: I wouldn't be suprised if she came from a broken home.
		        What do you say Dick?
		Dick: Yes....Or maybe shes adopted. That's more likely.

1984  Dirty Movie                        Mayall, Edmondson
                A proprieter of a small cinema gets a dirty movie. Will he
                be able to pass it off as a 9am screening of "The Sound of
                Muzak" [sic], or will his wife, the mailman, a traffic warden,
                the police, or a pet lobster come between him and his movie.

                Mailman Bean: I was just trying to see this film.
                Sargeant Peter: I bet you were, I bet you were, you dirty
                                bastard!
                PC Nigel: Ohhh! I get it! dirty bastard - dirty film, right?
                Sarge: Now then, whats your name?
                PC: Nigel!
                Sarge: Not you Nigel - you!
                Mailman: Mr Bean
                Sarge: It's a funny name for a lobster!
                PC: Sarge, He's not a lobster Sarge.
                Sarge: I know, I'm trying to disorientate him.
                PC: Don't do that, you'll get him confused.
                Sarge: Thats what I'm trying to do!
                PC: Ohhh, I get it.
                [PC Nigel smashes mailman in the face]
                PC: There, that's confused him!
                Sarge: Now get up. And that is just a warning!
                Mailman: A warning about what exactly?
                Sarge: A warning about....Tell him Nigel.
                PC: That is just a warning about what its like to get smashed
                    in the face SONNY!
                Sarge: Don't you forget it!

1984  Susie                              Richardson, Richens
		Randy schoolteacher meets drug-sodden pop star.

1984  A Fistfull of Travellers' Cheques  Richardson, Richens, Mayall
		Recreate Spaghetti Westerns (while on holiday in Spain).
                Meet the hitchhiker from hell and a psychotic matador
                along the way. Features Miguel - the mad Mexican from 'War'.

		Ticket Collector: Tickets! [gets ticket] Ehh What's this gringo?
		Carlos: It's a Euro-Rover - old man.

		Miguel: [ding] Hey, double B and B for one night capitan.
		Hotel Bastardos Manager: Get your hands off my counter tourist
		                         filth!
		Miguel: I think I like this place. Make that two weeks.

		Hotel Bastardos Manager: If you wanta soft toilet paper you go
		                         to Hotel Gayboy. You whinging Pommies.

		[Miguel and Carlos facing each other, Western showdown style]
		Carlos: You start the row.
		Miguel: I went first last time!
		Carlos: No you didn't.
		Miguel - Carlos: Did; Didn't; Did; Didn't; Did
		Carlos: *Did-not!* Sorry, have we started yet?
		Miguel: 'Course I have you great tosser.
		Carlos: Allright. Start again.
		Miguel: You calling me a liar?
		Carlos: Yes!
		Miguel: Well then, you're going to die.

1984  Gino - Full Story and Pics         Richardson, Richens
		Gino, on the run from the police, teams up with Angie.
		Together they meet a number of unusual characters, ranging
		from a psychotic divorcee to a murdering housewife.

		Max: My wife says I'm crazy and ought to be locked up;
		     perhaps she's right! God she's beautiful! Wish I could
		     see her. She won't let me in the house without a lawyer.
		     I mean, is thats not a proper marriage is it? ...
		     It's the nights I can't take. It was allright at first,
		     I stayed with friends. But you know what it's like when
		     you start falling over and frightening the children.

1984  Eddie Monsoon - A Life             Edmondson
		Bio of a South African TV host who's a perverted deviant, a
		lush, and very violent.

		Interesting facts: (1) There was to have been an Eddie Monsoon
		episode in series 1, but it was not made due to proposed
		content. Makes you wonder, if the stuff in this Eddie Monsoon
		episode was acceptable, what was the content of the unmade
		episode! The quote below is a reference to this "banned"
		episode. Michael White who plays himself as a TV producer is
		the actual producer of the Comic Strip Presents.
		(2) This is the origin of the name of Jennifer Saunders
		character in Absolutely Fabulous, Edwina Monsoon (Jennifer
		Saunders is married to Adrian Edmonson). (3) "Eddie Monsoon" is
		a bastardized version of Adrian Edmondson's surname, this is
		because the Eddie Monsoon character is, as Adrian himself has
		said, based on his personality when he is pissed.

                Eddie: I mean Channel 4 is *the* channel for child porn and
                       homosexuals and I had both in my show. So why'd you have
                       to go and ban it, just like that?
                Michael White: Eddie! If you'd really want to know..
                Eddie: Yes I do
                Michael: Then shutup and listen. The only reasons we had for
                         not transmitting "Back to normal with Eddie Monsoon"
                         are that it was obscene, libellous and in my opinion
                         an offense to humanity.

1984  Slags                              Saunders
		Set in a seedy futuristic, Bladerunner-like world, with shades
                of the B grade 'Surf Nazis must die' we hear of "The Slags", a
		gang into violence, and their war with "The Hawaiians", a gang
		into niceness.

		[Circular saw blade narrowly misses Ace's head]
		Street Urchin: Can we have our starflinger back Mister?
		Ace: When I was your age - I wouldn't have missed!

		Ricky: I want you to know, that we never touch anybody with
                       hate. We're only fighting for what is nice.

1984  The Bullshitters (1)               Richardson, Allen
		Sendup of "The Professionals", an action series about secret
		servicemen. Lots of shouting 'Lets go' and 'Cover me' while
		running around dressed only in leather jackets and underpants.

                Bonehead: The camera's running -the sound's rolling- I've got
                          to get inside that car. What's the first thing I
                          do - Troy?
                Troy: Start the engine, sir?
                Bonehead: No! Anybody - Quickly, come along.
                Chuck: Door acting sir?
                Bonehead: Very good, well done Chuck. All right, what's the
                          first thing I do with this door handle, Stig?
                Stig: Press it down sir?
                Bonehead: No! I do not press it down. The first thing you do
                          with a door handle is you do not look at it. Now
                          this is a good opportunity for a nice profile shot,
                          use it! You might not get another opportunity.
                          Plenty of looking up and down that street
                          -international terrorists are in town- the TV tough
                          guy never does what -Wayne?
                Wayne: Locks his car sir.
                Bonehead: And why?
                Chuck: Wasting film sir.
 
1986  Consuela                           French, Saunders
		Hitchcock suspense movie sendup, based on 'Rebecca'. Will
		the changes brought about by a new mistress of the house be
		welcomed by the maid Consuela?

                Jessica: I don't want to keep you from your duties Consuela,
                         I shall just pop into the village and pick up John's
                         shoes from the cobblers.
                Consuela: I've taken care of that madam. They're in his
                          wardrobe.
                Jessica: Oh good...well, I shall get some flowers to arrange
                         then, the house looks so drab.
                Consuela: I did that this morning madam.
                Jessica: Thank you Consuela. Then I shall be able to go out
                          this afternoon and sketch some ducks.
                Consuela: Took the liberty madam. [Holds up a drawing of
                          a duck]

1986  Private Enterprise                 Edmondson
		Small time crim, nicks a demo recording of a band and touts it
		as his own work. What do you know, the song is a success! What
		can he do when they start to arrange gigs and press conferences
		for the non-existant band?

		Keith: Look at it this way Brian; most people who do arson have
		       got some huge psychological problem, and they get
		       nothing out of it except maybe an erection. Whereas we
		       stand to make two hundered quid cancellation fee.
		Brian: I think I'd rather have an erection.
		Keith: Well, with a bit of luck, we might get both!

1988  The Strike                         Richardson, Richens
		The filming of the (Hollywood) adaptation of a book about the
		miners strike of 1985. Includes excerpts from the film "Strike:
		The Bloodbath Begins". What if Arthur Scargill - played by Al
		Pacino worked during the strike, and his wife - played by
		Merryl Streep had an unusual fixation on oranges!

                 Paul: Uhhm excuse me Mr Goldstein, the whole point of the
                       story is that the miners are on strike. It's the miners
                       strike, and that means the mines are closed-they're not
                       working.
                 Goldstein: So you're saying that this Scarface..
                 Verity: Scargill
                 Goldstein: Scargill-schmargill, you're saying that this guy,
                            the hunky hero, the head of the miners, you're
                            saying that he's too chicken-shit scared to go
                            down the mine and dig out Merryl Streep!
                 Bernard: I'm sorry, what's Merryl Streep got to do with it?
                 Goldstein: I dunno, she's available in July.

1988  More Bad News                      Edmondson
		The return of the heavy metal band Bad News, 5 years on, for
		a reunion record deal and concert. They actually perform live
		in front of 70,000 in the 'Monsters of Rock' show at Castle
		Donnington. I believe to get into their roles, Edmondson (Vim),
		Planer (Den), Mayall (Colin) and Richardson (Spider) actually
		toured and played a few gigs as all (except Mayall) can
                play their instruments. Includes the other 'Monsters' bands
		voicing their opinions of Bad News (Motorhead, Def Leppard,
		Scorpion and Ozzie Ozborne).
                See also the CD section at the end of this guide.

		Vim: Den, Den, That amp is pathetic. You couldn't amplify a
		     fart through that!
		Den: Yeah well, Gail's kid's gerbils been using it as a
		     toilet for the last 3 years.

		Den: [outside the recording studio toilet] Ohhhh, This is
		     really great. Just imagine, I could've just dumped in the
		     same bog as Eric Clapton, Mick Jagger, or Lemmy or Ozzie
		     Osborne. Who has been here?
		Documentary Maker: [Murmer murmer]
		Den: BANANARAMA!

1988  Mr Jolly Lives Next Door           Edmondson, Mayall, Rivron
		Drunkards running an escort agency live above an off-license
		and next to a psychopathic hit man (whose also into little
		fluffy toys). They get his contract to kill Nicholas Parsons
		(game show host in the UK) believing it to mean they have to
		literally 'take out' Parsons (and show him a good time).

		Rik: And she said: 'Well I don't think you're a fishmonger, I
                     think you've done a plop in the wrong lavatory!'

		Ade: Hey Nicholas look, I can light my fart! [zzzrrrppt-whoomph]
		Nicholas Parsons: What exactly [cough cough] was your winning
		                  slogan?
		Rik: Never ever bloody anything ever!
		Nick: And that was your winning slogan?
		Rik: That's the one Nikky. I've lived my life by that rule!
		Ade: Nicholas, I wonder if I can light my burps? [bbrrroooapp]
		Nick: I would like to spend an evening with Nicholas Parsons
		      because "never ever ever bloody anything ever".
		Rik: You're pissed aren't you Nicholas?

1988  The Yob                            Allen, Peacock
		Based on the movie "The Fly". What if an artistic, sensitive
		new age guy (but a wuss), who directs video clips for a living,
		was crossed with a neo-nazi hooligan via a cerebral transfer
		teleport? Features the band UB-40.

		Michael: The first clue was the bone structure. Indented
			 forehead, slightly Neaderthal brain casing, squarish
			 jaw. All hereditary signs of the introduction of
			 Norman blood into the Anglo-Saxon strain - 1066
			 William the Conquerer. They settled in London; they
			 were the first modern Londoners really.
		Debs: After that it was relatively simple. By scraping the
		      faeces that were left in the pod and taking samples
		      from the London sewerage plant we were able to discern
		      the exact district he came from.
		Michael: Barnett!
		Debs: So we knew we were looking for a yob from Barnett.
		Victoria: Brilliant!
		Michael: Not really, just the appliance of science.
		Victoria: And how did you find Patrick?
		Debs: Oh, we saw his picture in Vogue magazine.

1988  Didn't You Kill my Brother?        Sayle, Melville, Stafford
		Sayle plays identical twins, Carl and Sterling Moss. Together
		they ran a series of protection rackets, gambling clubs and
		dress hire shops - until one was busted. Now Carl is a reformed
		con and the most highly academically qualified person in
		Britain. Sterling however, is still an unreformed, bicycle
		stealing criminal.

		Ms Sneak: If I catch you making things you'll be back inside
			  pissing in a tin pot before you can say "Amnesty
			  International". Carl, you're going to be an
			  unstructured activities coordinator.
		Carl: Perhaps I could stay at the released offenders hostel
		      at Redbridge?
		Ms Sneak: Carl, you're a free man; you're *not* going anywhere.

		Carl: Hello there Laura, how old are you then?
		Laura: Physically I'm 8 but my teacher says I have the
		       emotional maturity of a 40 year old woman, so don't
		       patronise me right!
		Carl: Right? All right then Ashley, hows it going mate?
		Ashley: Sod off you nosey bastard!
		Ms Sneak: Ashley's rather hyperactive I'm afraid. He was born
			  while I was running the London Marathon. He came 10th.
		Ashley [whisper]: Sorry. We've been forced to be unmannerly.
		Laura [whisper]: Is there any way you could have us taken
				 into care?

		Mrs Moss: You should always put a dead badger on a head wound.

1988  Funseekers                         Planer, Lucie
                Looks at package holidays for the 18-30's for Sun, Sea and Sex.
		What if, shock-horror, one of the funseekers was an ancient 34!
		There is also some sort of surreal tie-in to a local inhabitant
		who is an unwed mother-to-be.

The early Comic Strips (up-to Funseekers) were made for Channel 4 England,
they are now made for BBC2. Generally these later Comic Strips are not as
interesting as the early shows. Thanks to Paul Rhodes, Stu Hamlin, Mark Moir,
and Pasters for the details of the early BBC2 episodes.


1990 South Atlantic Raiders              Richardson and Richens
		(This episode is shown in two parts)
                Ham radio operator loses contact with his new found,
		long-distance girlfriend who is based on the Falkland Islands.
		Naturally, he believes the reason for the lost contact is that
		the Falklands have been re-invaded by the Argentinians. So he
		and his friend set off down to the South Atlantic to rescue
		her. Mind you, simply getting some money together to finance
		the operation and leaving Britain is an adventure in itself.

		Rollo: How much combat experience have we all had?
		Billy: 'S not necessary. Killings instinctive, as long as you
		       hate people enough and watch the right films.
		       "First Blood" were good, errr, then they done "Rambo"
		       but it were a bit commercial for my taste.
		Rollo: How about you Stan?
		Stan:  Well, I don't like "Rambo" either.

		Passenger: I'll have a Bloody Mary.
		Billy: We've only got bloody Lager!

1990 GLC                                 Richardson and Richens
		From J R Goldstein, the same producer who brought you "Strike:
		The Bloodbath Begins", comes another Hollywood adaptation of an
		event in the life of left wing politics in Britain, "GLC: The
		Carnage Continues". Starring Charles Bronson as Ken Livingstone,
		Lee Van Cleef as Tony Benn, Cher as Joan Ruddock, and
		introducing Bridget Neilson as Margaret 'Ice Maiden' Thatcher.
		Music by Kate Bush.

		Alec [at the film's premiere]: Earlier on this evening I spoke
		     to one of the stars of GLC, Charles Bronson, who plays
		     the part of Ken Livingstone.
		Bronson: Its a story about an ordinary guy whose wife and
		         family get wiped out by these creeps so naturally he
		         has to follow them and wipe them out one at a time in
		         a prolonged and very cruel way.
		Alec: I see, thank you. And what next for Bronson?
		Bronson: Well we've got a new twist next time. We're doing a
		         film about a guy whose wife and family aren't wiped
		         out, but who decides to go after creeps just the same.

1990 Oxford                              Richardson and Richens
		Oxford University, traditionally a nursery for spies of all
		nationalities and political persuasions (who obtain a good
		grounding in the principles of comedic timing and the poetry
		of Lord Byron into the bargain). Music by The Pretenders.

		Steve: I went to Russia for assessment and, because of my
		       natural comic timing, I was sent to the KGB comendy
		       training camp in Minsk. When I returned to the west I
		       realized, like so many other Soviet trained comics, that
		       if my cover as a comedian was to hold, not only did I
		       have to be hilariously funny but a paranoid manic
		       depressive as well!
		Caroline: My God! Just like Tony Hancock, and Peter Sellers,
		          and John Cleese!
		Professor: KGB are very thorough Caroline. What did they use
		           Steven? Ego inflating drugs? Adulation treatment?

1990 Spaghetti Hoops                     Richardson and Richens
		A farce loosely based on the (a?) Italian banking crisis of

		Bertoli: There's absolutely no way I'd drop him in it.
		Inspector: Do you know what we will do to you if you don't
		           start "spreading the pasta"?
		Bertoli: What will you do?
		Inspector: We will do...."things" to you.
		Bertoli: What things?
		Inspector: Can't tell you that yet, because they're too
			   horrible to talk about.
		Policeman 1: And we haven't had our breakfast yet!
		Policeman 2: More croissant Inspector?
		Inspector: No, more cake. And be very generous with the cream.
		Policeman 3: Leave room for your five course lunch won't you,
			     you evil policeman you.
		Inspector: Right. Lets start the torture.

		If you want to see musician Kate Bush, in her acting debut,
		licked by a chocolate smeared yobbo this is the episode for
		you. Music by 'Les Dogs'

		Bride's Mother: It would help to lighten the atmosphere if you
				could start playing your music now.
		Les Dogs band leader: No.
		Bride's Mother: Look, they're not firing in; in your direction.
				All the shots are going across the room so
				you're quite safe. Please, it would help, and
				we *have* booked you.

1991  The Crying Game                    Allen, Richardson

                Butcher: Well we're very happy that at last someone has seen
                         sense and is promoting British meat. It just goes to
                         show that if British bangers are good enough for
                         Brush, then they're good enough for Britain.
                Scum Editor: Sausage debate, the big sausage, the bad
                          sausage, the burned sausage?
                Janet: The good, the bad and the sausage?

                         "Looney veggies slam Brush". Scum editorial "Shuddup
                         says Scum, leave our bangers alone" Right I want 20

                         another of your fabulous competitions.

		However, a circus accident neccessitates his recall. Can
		he juggle (pun intended - and the answer is no, he isn't a
		very good clown) his job of being a circus clown with that of
		Prime Minister? To give Major a love interest, the part of
		leader of the (Labour) opposition is not played by Neil
		Kinnock, but by his wife Glenys Kinnock -watch for their
		sizzling love scenes! BTW The credits show that the original
		music for this episode was co-written by Spider Webb, one of
		the members of Bad News.

		John Major's Dad: You're useless. You can't juggle, you can't
		     ride a horse, you're no good on the highwire 'cause you're
		     afraid of heights. The elephants all hate you. You can't
		     throw a knife, you can't breath fire. We can't even fire
		     you out of a cannon without you getting a nosebleed or
		     screaming that you've gone deaf. You've got absolutely
		     no circus skills whatsoever. You're a failure and a
		     disgrace to our ancient circus family. You're good for
		     nothing John Major.

		Major: For years I had secretly dreamed of working in a bank
		       or a tax office. So I headed vaguely in the direction
		       of the city. Already I was entering an enchanting world
		       of stationery and office equipment. This was my
		       Disneyland! Binders, A4 filing, A2 and A6, reciept books
		       and rulers and propelling pencils, calculators.....

Notes:
	(1) Not Billed as a Comic Strip Film mainly as writer/co-star Allen
            didn't want to go under the Comic Strip name at the time.
        (2) Regular Comic Strip members have only cameo appearances.
	(3) Not billed as a Comic Strip film.

Ratings:
	As all the Comic strip episode (with a few exceptions) have very
	different storylines and characters, some shows hit the mark a lot
	better than others. While ratings are always contentious and highly
	subjective I have made some general recommendations. This will be
	especially useful if you haven't seen any of the Comic Strip presents,
	as we don't want to scare you off just because you happened to see one
	of the "less interesting" episodes. Mind you, don't let this rating
	guide put you off seeing the other episodes, as each episode is very
	different, a show I don't rate highly may be listed as an all-time
	great by other people (examples include Gino and GLC). I have only
	listed the well above average shows.

	***** 	Mr Jolly Lives Next Door: The general Internet concensus is
		this is the best Comic Strip show ever. Rik Mayall and Ade
		Edmonson at their anarchic best.
	****1/2 Bad News Tour, More Bad News (Also, listen to Bad News'
		CD/Albums and see the video clip of their cover of Bohemian
		Rhapsody)
		Dirty Movie: Rik and Ade anarchic and pointless as usual, but
		damn funny.
		A Fistfull of Travellers' Cheques: A slow development to the
		story (lots of moody walking about Spain) but if you like this
		one, you'll really like it.
	****	Eddie Monsoon -A Life: Q) Is Ade Edmonson writing without Rik
		Mayall less anarchic, as the Bad News episodes imply? A) No!
		This is one of the more offbeat episodes. Some (well a lot) of
		the humour is "off" but if that's what turns you on, this will
		be one of the great Comic Strips episodes.
	***1/2	5 Go Mad in Dorsett, 5 Go Mad on Mescalin, War, Private
		Enterprise, The Strike, Didn't you Kill my Brother?, South
		Atlantic Raiders, Queen of the Wild Frontier.

	(Methuen 1989, ISBN 0-413-17390-9)

	There is a script book of the first Channel 4 series (up to Summer 
	School) it also contains some Eddie Monsoon material.

Music:
	Thanks to Chris Russell, John Butcher, McClane The Dominator
	and Paul Rhodes for this info.

	BAD NEWS
	There is a CD available of the music of Bad News. Titled 'Bad News',
	it includes the smash hits; Warriors of Ghengis Khan, Bad News,
	Masturbike, and a live version of Hey Hey Bad News. Includes a very
	badly played, but very funny cover of Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody.
	(Brian May produced the recording). Between the songs there are
	conversational pieces, like their annual general meeting and how they
	will split the money from the recording contract.
	It was released on the Rhino/Rampage label to coincide with the second
	of the two Bad News Comic Strip Episodes; Catalogue Number R2 70931

	Vim: I sing it so hard that my rectum seems to prolapse.

	The CD is a compilation of two LP/tapes Bad News have recorded,
	called 'Bad News' and 'Bootleg'. The CD contains all the first
	album and some tracks from the second and has the same cover
	photo as the first album. There is also a live album, called,
	you guessed it, "Bad News Live" which has on side A their
	Hammersmith Odeon concert and on side B is their Donnington
	Monsters of Rock concert (the concert featured in 'More Bad News').

	There is a video clip of their Bohemian Rhapsody cover. It is in two
	parts. The first is their badly played version of the song, and the
	second part has them finding out that, as well as the clip, the
	contract specifies that they have to provide 3 minutes of additional
	footage. They have spent all the money on the clip and have nothing
	left over, so the three minutes is spent with the band trying to do it
	all themselves and consists mainly of dialogue of the band members
	arguing and complaining. Mind you, when does anything about Bad News
	_not_ mainly consist of dialogue of the band members arguing :-)

	GLC
	The theme to GLC (plus some incidental music) is the B-side of Kate 
	Bush's Love and Anger single and possibly it is on the "This
	Woman's Work" box set.
	"Ken is the man that we all need! Ken is the leader of the GLC!"

Videos:
	Some Comic Strip shows have been released on video (at least in
        Australia). Released by Polygram video for Channel 4 with the title 
        "Comic Strip Classics"

		2) Bad News Tour + More Bad News
		3) Fistfull Cheques + Gino
		4) Mr Jolly + Dirty Movie
		5) Susie + Consuela
		6) Bullshitters + The Yob

        There are a lot of variations and combinations of Comic Strip episodes
        available on video from different distributors. 
	Under the label of the The Home Cinema Group, with the Title 
        "Comic Strip Volume #" I have seen; Volume 1: Didn't you kill my
        Brother? + Eddie Monsoon and Volume 2: Mr Jolly + Consuela
        While Virgin video have released both Bad News episodes (one per video)
        in a music video category and Thorn EMI have released some, for example,
        5 Go Mad + Bullshitters + Travellers Cheques. The Channel 4 season 3
        episodes have also been released singly on video (they had a limited
        theatre run as well as being shown on TV).

Misc Notes on The Black Adder

The four series and the Christmas special aired on cable's Arts and 
Entertainment network (A&E).  The Black Adder II episode "Beer" did not air on 
A&E as well as the Black Adder The Third episode "Nob and Nobility".

Each episode in the first series varied in length (30 to 34 minutes), while the 
episodes in the other three series ran 29 minutes each.  The Christmas special 
ran 45 minutes.  A&E edits the episodes to 22.5 minutes to make room for 
commercials with 45 seconds edited out of the Christmas special for some 
unknown reason.

The syndicated order of the episodes in the first series is based on the date 
given in the episode, not on the episode number which appears onscreen with the 
title.  Thus, the second and fourth episodes ("The Queen of Spain's Beard" and 
"Born to be King") are switched, running fourth and second.        
        
Black Adder II and Black Adder the Third each won the cable ACE award for best 
comedy series.  The third series also won an ACE award for costume design.
	
The first three series are available to PBS stations.  Some stations have not 
aired "The Archbishop" while other stations have skipped over "Beer".  "Nob and 
Nobility" is not available due to some legal problems concerning the copyright 
of the name "The Scarlet Pimpernel", the episode is available on home video, 
though.
	
CBS/Fox has released two "Blackadder III" tapes in the US with the first tape 
containing the first three "Black Adder the Third" epsiodes ("Dish and 
Dishonesty", "Ink and  Incapability", and "Nob and Nobility") and the second 
tape containing the other three episodes ("Sense and Senility", "Amy and 
Amiability", and "Duel and Duality").List price is $19.98.  All four series 
have been released in the UK by BBC Video with  "Black Adder: The Cavalier 
Years" appearing on a UK Comic Relief tape "Exclusive Relief". 
	
"Blackadder Goes Forth" is the last series according to Richard Curtis and 
John Lloyd in an article in The Times in Nov '89.

Black Adder Lyrics


Original transcriptions by Jeff Hildebrand
Corrections and other transcriptions by Ron Hayter


"The Black Adder" (episodes 1-5) [Added by RSH.]

The sound of hoof beats 'cross the glade.
Good foe, lock up your son and daughter.
Beware the deadly flashing blade,
Unless you want to end up slaughtered.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  He rides a pitch black steed.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  He's very fair indeed.

Black.  His gloves of finest wool.
Black.  His codpiece made of metal.
His horse is blacker than a hole.
His pot is blacker than his kettle.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  With many an cunning plan.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  You are a little man.

"The Black Seal" (episode 6) [Added by RSH.]

So now the wage of sin is dead.
The blameless dead, the black stead grazes.
The only sound across the glade
Is Edmund pushing up the daisies.

Black Adder, Black Adder, a shame about the plan.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  Tha' worked, you horrid man.


"Bells"
Lord Flashheart tweaked the Adder's beard.
From now he always shall be single.
To fall in love with boys is weird,
Especially boys without a dingle.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  His taste is rather odd.
Black Adder, Black Adder, the randy little sod.

Lord Flashheart, Lord Flashheart, I wish you were the star.
Lord Flashheart, Lord Flashheart, you're sexier by far.

"Head" [Added by RSH.]
His great-grandfather was a king,
Although for only thirty seconds.
When put in charge of beheading,
He felt that fame and glory beckoned.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  No such blooming luck.
Black Adder, Black Adder, Elizabethan shmuck.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  Nothing goes as planned.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  Life deals him a bum hand.

"Potato"
Sir Francis and Sir Walter had
Discovered new worlds and new nations.
And though Black Adder thought them mad,
He tried his hand at navigation.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  He saw the ocean's foam.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  He should have stayed at home.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  He heard the new world's call.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  He discovered bugger-all.

"Money"
Take heed the moral of this tale:
Be not a borrower or lender.
And if your finances do fail,
Make sure your banker's not a bender.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  He trusted in the church.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  It left him in the lurch.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  His life was almost done.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  Who gives a toss?  No one.

"Beer"
Black Adder couldn't hold his beer.
The art of boozing he's not mastered.
And I, your merry balladeer,
Am also well and truly plastered.

Black Adder, Black Adder, a bit like Robin Hood.
Black Adder, Black Adder, but nothing like as good.

Black Ad-hic, Black Adder.  I thought that he had died.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  Our writers must have lied.

"Chains"
Beware all ye who lust for fame.
The path of life is most uncertain.
Prince Ludwig thought he'd won the game.
But now the Kraut's gone for a burton.

Black Adder, Black Adder.  He beat the Hun by luck.
Black Adder, Black Adder.  He's smarter than a duck.

Lord Melchitt, Lord Melchitt, intelligent and deep.
Lord Melchitt, Lord Melchitt, a shame about the sheep.

Blackadder lyrics.  Three corrections I'm sure of; the "vole" one
I'm not sure.

Notes

 1. The date given is the first airing date on NBC. During the first season,
 the stories aired on Sundays, except for one special on a Tuesday night.
 During the second season, the stories were first aired on Monday nights,
 with one special on a Friday. The Monday time-slot started on 6/30/87,
 during reruns. But, starting with story 41, the stories were moved to
 Friday nights.

 2. The air time shown is based on the Central Time zone.

 3. The time given is edited length, from beginning of the opening to the
 final note of the Universal ending, without commercials.

 4. The opening theme music was changed the first time, starting 11/03/85.
 The opening theme music was again changed on 6/8/86 (possibly 6/1/86).
 This time the music doesn't exactly sync, or time, with the visual opening.
 On 6/15/86, the theme music reverted to what it was the second time.

 5. During the second season, NBC started airing previews of the show
 before the show started. But, the preview for story 37 was actually the
 preview for story 38.

 6. Story 32 was to have aired the week of Halloween (11/27/86, 7:00).
 But the postponed, by rain, last game of the World Series prempted it.

 7. The title sequence was changed on 1/19/87. The co-starring list was shown
 during the opening credits. This format change only lasted for the one story.

 8. The TV Guide that can be seen in the story "Blue Man Down" is the
 Aug 30-Sep 5, 1986, issue. The cover story is: Help For Dallas EXPLORING
 THE MYSTERY OF BOBBY'S RETURN. In the story "Such Interesting Neighbors",
 the TV Guide looked like an issue with a cover picture of Jerry Lewis.
 The cover date is unknown, but it was before March 16, 1985.

 9. The second season was to have 22 stories, making a total of 46.
 But Amblin Entertainment shut down production. One story is still due NBC.
 Two possible titles for this story are "Dream Girl" and "Trapped".

10. All stories are in stereo and were aired in stereo.

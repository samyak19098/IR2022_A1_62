This is a cast list for the show current up to the final episode.  It is
based on one posted earlier by Jerry Boyajian, which is in turn based on
one posted by Jon Conrad.  It includes all of the regulars, and a few of
the important/interesting minor characters.

This list is updated periodically.

When two different people played the same character, the first one
listed appeared in the pilot, and the second in later episodes.

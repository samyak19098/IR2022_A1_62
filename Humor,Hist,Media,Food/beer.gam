Subject: Beer Games (long, but good)

I got several suggestions to post my favortie beer games, so here they
are.  Because some are long I omitted a few, but I will post those
soon.  I didn't have time to check spelling, and, as all beer gamers
know, the changing of rules is directly proportional to the 
geographic distance from where the game was orginated, so don't
flame me.  If you have any favorties please send them to me, but PLEASE
no quarters games, I have TOO many already.  Thanks.

(one or two rules taken from "The Complete Book of Beer Drinking Games",
Griscom, Ben Rand, Scott Johnston. Mustang Publishing.

Burn-Out:
---------

 Materials:

 a paper napkin
 a lit cigarette
 a dime
 a glass (preferably short with a wide mouth)
 beer!!

 The set up:

  Place the napkin over the top of the glass and pull it down around the
  sides.  Next, wet the rim of the glass with the napkin on it so the
  napkin stays down along the sides when you let go.  Now place the
  dime in the center of the napkin.

 The play:

  Players must take turns burning holes out of the napkin, the player
  who burns the hole that causes the dime to fall in the glass must
  drink. Generally,the penalty is to drink a glass full of beer, usually
  the same size as the play glass. This game is great for bars, everyone
  will want to join in.  

 M*A*S*H:
 -------

 Materials:

 beer (lots of it)
 a TV

 The play:

  Each player should choose a character from the tv show.  Whenever that
  person's name is said the player must drink (eg: Capt. Benajmin Pierce
  Hawkeye, Benji, Capt. Pierce, Hawk. Not just Capt.).There are a couple  
  of house rules that my friends stick to with this one, if two players
  are playing M*A*S*H the players will each choose one major character 
  and two minor characters and so on for three players and up.

 Similar games:

  Hi Bob: Watching 'Newhart' 
   Everytime someone says "Hi Bob" all players must drink.  This
   game is great with 5+ players.

  Chug Boat: Watching 'Love Boat'

   Choose characters.  The boat itself is legal.  And, if possible, watch
   any two hour special.

Beer Golf:
---------

 Materials:

 beer (9 or 18, how much can you handle?)
 a golf course (preferably one you don't usually go to)
 golf clubs

 The Play:

  Drink one beer for each hole of golf you play.  Simple as that, just
  try sinking that putt on the 9th.

Bullshit:
--------

 Materials:

 beer (are you getting this pattern yet?)
 people

 The set up:

  Someone designates himself the leader, or the person who will
  initiate the game, this person must know the game. The game begins
  by each player choosing a type of shit to be designated by 
  (eg: one person would be horse shit, another sheep shit, etc.) 
  and all of the players sit around a table or in a circle on the
  floor.

 The play:

  The leader then yells "Someone shit in the parlor" and all of the
  players yell "Who shit?", the leader will now blame one of the
  players by saying "Dogshit" (or whatever).  Now that player,
  feeling like he has been accused of something he didn't do says
  "bullshit".  The leader will then ask him who did it by saying
  "Who shit?", the player originally accused must then accuse someone
  else.  This goes on until someone blows it, the penalty can be
  anything from a glass of beer to a full beer, depending on how
  often the people are screwing up.

Dunk the Duchess:
----------------

 Materials:

  Two full pitchers
  bar glass

 The set up:

  Take the glass and float it in one of the pitchers, a short, fat
  glass usually works well, and you may need to pour a little beer
  in the floating glass to steady it.

 The play:

  Each player takes turns pouring beer from the second pitcher into
  the floating glass.  The person who sinks the glass must retrieve
  it and drink what's in it.  The rule for glass ownership is the
  five second rule, you are responsible for the glass for five seconds
  after you pour the beer into it, counting out loud in the best way
  to keep track of this.  One important rule is that you may not rest
  any part of your arm or hand on the pitcher that has the floating
  glass.  This, like Burn-out, is a great bar game.

Mexicali:
--------

 Materials:

  a cup (not see through)
  dice 
  beer, beer, beer

 The Play:

  Players sit around a table and take turns shaking the dice in the
  cup, turning it over onto the table, and telling the next person
  (the person to the left) what they rolled.  The object here is to
  get a higher roll than the person before you.  Sometimes, of
  course, you won't get a higher roll, so you will want to lie.  The
  next person will then determine whether or not he believes what you
  told him.  If he believes you he takes the cup and dice and rolls
  his turn, and the game goes on.  If he doesn't believe you he
  may say so (first) and then pick up the cup and check, if you
  lied you drink, otherwise he drinks and it is your turn again.  When
  a player lies and someone catches him he must drink and play begins
  again with a clean slate (the last roll was zero).

  There are certain rolls that are important and the dice have certain
  values for each roll.  Doubles are highest, and at that double
  sixes are the highest of all of the doubles.  From there the
  highest is 65 (or a six and a five) then 64 and on down.  A roll
  of 31 is a reverse, which may be checked by a non-believer, a 
  41 is a social, or everyone drinks (usually toasting) and a roll
  of 21 is a Mexicali.  A Mexicali must be announced right away, by
  lifting up the cup and saying so.  A Mexicali means that the 
  person who rolled gets to choose someone to drink and then may make
  a rule.  After any of these rolls play resumes with the last roll
  as zero.  Rules are the same as quarters rules.

  Party Fouls:

  This is very important, and any true Mexicali player knows that these
  rules must be enforced and anyone who breaks these rules must suffer
  the consequences (usually a drink, perhaps two).

  A party foul is a breaking of any of the cardinal rules of Mexicali
  and someone must yell "Party foul!" when they spot an infraction.

  Party foul #1:  Touching the dice.  Touching the dice at any time 
  ..  during play is strictly forbidden.  In order to
   ..  get the dice back in the cup a novice player
  ..  will put their palm (up) against the table, slide the
 ..  cup over their palm so that the dice are now resting 
 ..  on the palm (this touching is allowed) and will
  ..  then, without ever grasping the dice, flip the cup 
..  and palm over so the dice fall to the bottom of
..  the cup.  A real player will swiftly slide to cup
   ..  off the table and flip it over in one smooth
..  motion causing the dice to fall to the bottom.
  Party foul #2:  Sliding a cup.  A cup must NEVER be slid while the
..  current roll is still in play.  If a player says,
..  "I rolled a 65"  the next player, if he wishes to
..  check the validity of this statement, must lift the
..  cup up from wherever the last player flipped it
..  over.  Sliding will happen a lot with the new players
..  so watch for this one.
  Party foul #3:  Dropping the dice on the floor.  This is bad, and the
..  only time a player is allowed to touch the dice, 
 .   .  although he probably doesn't have to anyway.  The 
..  person who gets to pick up the dice is the next
.    .  player.  Play begins again with  a new slate. 
  Party foul #4:  Naming a wrong number.  Anyone who says "56" when
. .  it is obvious that "65" is better deserves to
 .   .  drink.  Same goes for not calling "special rolls".
 ..  Play begins with the next person with a 
..  clean slate.  
  Party foul #5:  Spilling a beer.  Sacrilege!!  A whole beer must be
..  consumed for this one. 
  Party foul #6:  Forgetting the last roll.  This is less of a party
..  foul than the rest.  If a player forgets the previous
..  roll he must rol anyway and hope he gets (he lies and
..  says he does) a better roll.  If the person after the
..  guy who forgot knows what's up and the forgetful
..  player says a number that is lower than the 
..  roll that he forgot that next player may call a 
  ..  foul.
  Party foul #7:  Forgetting and trying to pull it off, or just screwing
..  up.  If the roll was 54 to me, and I said 43, any
..  player in the group may call a foul.  I deserve to
..  drink for that.

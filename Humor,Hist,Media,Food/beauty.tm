I just finished watching my copy of the Beauty and the Beasty: Work in
Progress laser disc, and out of curiousity, while watching the movie, I
decided to literally count how many minutes (or frames) of full
color animation were missing from this laser disc release.

For those not wishing to read any further, here's the result: in my count,
I found that 61.8% of the movie (not including end credits) was final
color animation. The rest is a divided up into storyboard, rough animation
and cleanup animation. Or roughly 49 minutes of the 80 minutes I counted were
final, full color animation.

Although I first thought this timing analysis was going to be an extremely
tedious and time consuming process, I actually enjoyed the time I spent
stepping through all the "work-in-progress" material. It made me appreciate
the film even more, and the craftsmanship and artistry that goes behind
making a film like this. Oh...and I ended up appreciating even more
the jog/shuttle dial on my laser disc player's remote control ;-)

The only disappointment I had was that this work in progress release, IMHO,
did not contain enough full color animation at key scenes at the end of
the film: it contains no final color animation of the Beast after he was
transformed back to a Prince. Nor is there color animation of Belle and the
Prince dancing at the end. Sigh. Also, did I mention the fact that the two
discs came with those cheesy, thin, inner plastic sleeves. Ughh!

Anyway, if you're a animated film lover, you'll enjoy this release. At first,
I had refused to buy this "crippled" disc, and it was only until reading
few glowing posts here in rec.video.releases that I decided to purchase it.
I picked up a copy earlier this week at the new Virgin records MegaStore
in Hollywood (about a dozen still in stock), since my usual LD hangount,
Ken Crane's in Westminster, was all out.

What follows is a time summary, and a detailed frame-by-frame summary of
the film. There's a good chance that I could have mixed up my Rough Animation
and Cleanup Animation labels on a few sequences, but that shouldn't really
throw off the final numbers. Enjoy. (And sorry for the stray quote marks
that might appear in the detailed summary. I don't what Excel was up to
when I converted the spreadsheet to text.)

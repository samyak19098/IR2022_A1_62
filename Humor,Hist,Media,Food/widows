          Widows Peak is, to say the least, an interesting place to
     live, provided you're the right type of tenant:  widowed, middle-
     aged, moneyed, and a nosy busy-body.  Joan Plowright (ENCHANTED
     APRIL, 1992) stars as Mrs. D-C (short for a surname that's pro-
     nounced three different ways, depending on the actor's accent),
     the matriarch of Kilshannon, Ireland, during the 1920s.  Kil-
     shannon is better known as Widows Peak, due to the large popula-
     tion of widows that have settled in town.  Set apart from the
     rest is the widow Catherine O'Hare (Mia Farrow).  Mrs. O'Hare
     isn't moneyed like the rest, nor does she seem to be quite in her
     right mind.  She's stand-offish and peculiar, but because Mrs.
     D-C accepts her, much like a pitiful puppy that needs looking
     after, the others accept her as well.  She's the odd duck of this
     little community, until Mrs.  Edwina Broome (Natasha Richardson)
     shows up.

          Brash and brassy, Mrs. Broome seems a perfect precursor to
     the '20s flapper girls:  open and sexy, with a hint of danger in
     her smile.  She naturally flaunts all conventions, arriving in
     town in the company of Godfrey (Adrian Dunbar), Mrs.  D-C's only
     son.  Tongues begin wagging at once, and Edwina encourages it.

          It's fun to watch the dynamics between Edwina and the towns-
     people; Edwina's a bit of a tart and Richardson plays her to the
     hilt, alternately thrilling the townsmen and shocking the widows.
     She's an Englishwoman with a touch of American sauciness to her,
     and quite a lot of American duplicity.  Her hiring of the town's
     most gossipy maid, known locally as Mattie O'Hara (cringe), seems
     to show she had nothing to hide.  If you're not careful, you'll
     be fooled by her shell game, her three-card-monte con of a life
     story.  And that's exactly what happens to Catherine.  The two
     meet for the first time at the showing of a silent movie, taking
     an immediate dislike to each other.  Of course, it doesn't help
     that Mrs. D-C asks Catherine to move down a seat for Edwina.

          Predictably, the rivalry flares up into a feud at the next
     social event, a dance.  Edwina accidentally bumps Catherine out
     of the running for a prize.  Catherine, none too happy, takes her
     Irish-born hatred of the English out on Edwina, essentially
     declaring war on the symbolic representation of England.  Folks
     dismiss the feud at first, noting that Catherine always takes in
     English boarders during the tourist season.  They chalk her alarm
     up to her seeming mental instability, until she begins speaking
     of "Murderrr."  A boat race in the second act appears to legiti-
     mize her fears, but pay close attention:  things aren't as they
     appear.

          The screenplay, originally written by Hugh Leonard nearly 20
     years ago for Maureen O'Hara (in the Mia Farrow role), owes an
     obvious influence to THE STING (1972), starring Paul Newman and
     Robert Redford.  It's clever, if a bit shallow, and if you watch
     closely you'll piece the con together by the big dinner scene
     where Catherine "reveals" Edwina's sordid past.  Everyone present
     seems to be having great fun (who wouldn't kill for any of these
     delicious roles?), Farrow's Irish brogue is convincingly light
     and lilting, and despite the predictability, WIDOWS PEAK is a
     great place to spend an afternoon.

     RATING:  $$$

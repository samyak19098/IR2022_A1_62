Allusions to other works within Twin Peaks -- Edition 3

Note: these are not meant to be read as a definite link to all these works; 
some may be coincidences. In general, most are lighthearted jabs, but some 
have real value in solving the mysteries of Twin Peaks. Actually, these are 
more likely "footnotes" rather than "allusions". (List originator and editor:

SEASON ONE
   (In chronological order starting with 1000):

   1. The Bird:  Blue Velvet ends with a shot of a robin with a bug in its 
mouth.
   
   2. "Twin Peaks": Supposedly a fairly obvious sexual reference, I hadn't 
heard it used before, although SPY's "Separated At Birth?" book (published 
1988) commented on the "Twin (widow's) Peaks" of Bob Eubanks and Butch 
(Eddie Munster) Patrick. As well, for a town even more obssessed with 
lumber, TP has nothing on Lumberton from Blue Velvet. Also, Blake Edward's 
1962  thriller "Experiment In Terror" features Lee Remick as a bank clerk 
terrorized by a psycho into stealing from her employers. She lives in 
Twin Peaks (in San Francisco) and  the psycho's name is Red Lynch!! (CN) 
Finally, Entertainment Tonight ran two separate stories on Snoqualmie, WA 
(where the TP pilot was filmed) and Twin Peaks, CA (where Lynch is 
rumoured to have some land), both of which have grisly murders in their 
past.

   3. Harry S. Truman: Not only in reference to the former U.S. president. 
The name of the man who lived near Spirit Lake under Mt. St. Helens and 
refused to move from his home despite the warning of volcanic eruption was 
named Harry Truman, as well (JS).
   
   4. The name "Laura": In the 1944 movie Laura, a girl named Laura is 
killed, only to turn up as someone else. Also in the film, the villian's name 
is Waldo (!) Lydecker (!!), and a gun is hidden in a clock, a la the poker 
chip from One Eyed Jacks. As well, in a coincidence David Lynch would 
probably shrug off, the film starred Dana Andrews, whose initials bear a 
resemblance to TP's own Dana Ashbrook. A Laura Palmer is credited with 
writing a piece on the fall of Saigon for Rolling Stone. Also, note possible 
connection with Laura Dern. 

   5. Andy the crying deputy: In an (early 1990) arc of Wiseguy revolving 
around a murder in a small lumber town, the police officer that found the 
body cried upon its discovery. It was later revealed that the officer himself 
was the culprit. (This is probably not a coincidence. The plot of the TP pilot 
was well-known within TV circles. Further proof: the town's name was 
"Lynchboro"). Last thing on this: the Globe tabloid reported a week before 
2006 that Andy killed Laura and was going to murder Lucy, who was planning 
to have an abortion.

   6. Leland Palmer: There are two very small (pop.30 and 25 in 1963) 
towns in Washingron State named Leland and Palmer (DGP). As well, an 
actor named Leland Palmer starred in Bob Fosse's All That Jazz. (LTC).

   7. The song Bobby (and much later James) plays on the jukebox is from 
the Lynch/Badalamenti Industrial Symphony. It's called "I'm Hurt Bad".

   8. Ronette on the railroad tracks: Possible redux of Isabella 
Rosselini's nude wandering in Blue Velvet.
   
   9.  James The Biker: In an Interview interview, James Marshall said 
that David Lynch actually told him to think of James Dean while acting.
   	
   10. Nadine's oneeye:  Numerous references, too many to list, but 
probably the one that applies here is the character on "Days Of Our Lives". 
(Actually, The character on "DOOL" is a hardened, tough male loner, but 
Nadine does exhibit some tough characteristics, don't you think?)

   11. Dale Cooper: Dale's middle name is Bartholomew, marking him D.B. 
cooper, a la the famous skyjacker. Kyle MacLachlan's performance is said to 
have been inspired by Lynch himself.

   12. The OAM: The most famous example of a one-armed man is, of 
course, the killer in the Fugitive. On that show, Richard Kimble's pursuant 
was named Phillip Gerard.

   13. The flickering lights: Apparently an actual hospital goofup, Lynch 
liked it so much he decided to flicker the lights himself. However, the 
lights-flickering motif was prevalent in Blue Velvet, Eraserhead, and even 
Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. As well, a script purported to be the first draft
has a mention of this.

   14. The videotape: Numerous, including Sex Lies and Videotape.

   15. The reflection in Laura's eye: used on a soap opera in the summer 
of 1990, don't know which one. (This is, of course, an homage, rather than an 
influence).

   16. The fallen deerhead: The first of many possible references to 
Fawlty Towers, which of course also featured a hotel with a harried owner 
(DGP). Yet it was a moose head in the Fawlty Towers episode(RH). (However, 
DP notes that the deerhead was just discovered that way by Lynch, which sounds
at least a little more plausible)

   17. "Fire, Walk With Me". Fire, is of course, one of the most enduring
symbols in all religions and mythologies, but a few instances that are 
relevant to TP: Lynch's own use of fire in other works (Blue Velvet, Wild At
 Heart) as passion or danger, and the relgious rites of the druids. The druids 
held wood, mistletoe (which is a parasitic plant), and fire as religious rites. 
This suggests ties with TP in terms of the spirits trapped in wood, 
BOB-as-a-parasite, and BOB-as-fire.

   18. The Log Lady: According to the Rolling Stone Interview with Lynch, 
The Log Lady predates Twin Peaks; Lynch was planning an earlier series 
with Catherine Coulson starring as the Log Lady. 
    
   19. "Falling"/"The Nightingale": The first of a few Julee Cruise 
numbers spliced into the action. 

(From 1001) 
   
   20.  "Marilyn Monroe and the Kennedys": An obsession shared by 
Cooper, Lynch, and Frost, who wrote a script for Goddess, a Monroe movie 
that was to be directed by Lynch.

(From 1002)

   21.  Ben & Jerry: Twin Peak's largest food freaks share their names 
with the allPnatural icePcream merchants. 

   22. OnePEyed Jack's: another crude sexual reference, fully explained  
by Bobby Peru in "Wild At Heart". Also, the Western with Marlon Brando.

   23. Horne's Sonnet: Shakespeare, Sonnet No. 18

   24. The Dream: Mark Frost has said that the dream imagery (including 
the owls) come from his own dreams. The tone and style, however, is pure 
Lynch. As commented in the newsgroup before, Lynch is known for his 
strange pauses and lags in action at inopportune times. this dates back to
"Eraserhead", which featured many strange, quiet moments. Cooper's 
reaction shots hearken back to that film and Jack Nance's lack of emotion. 

   25. BOB: The name "Bob" is a source of constant commentary. Lynch is 
well known for his daily sojurns to Bob's Big Boy.The recently-published Bob 
Book characterizes "Bob" as a generally benevolent guy, although it 
acknowledges the evil BOB. Among notable BobsI A "Bob" is thanked on Julee 
Cruise's Floating Into The Night LP; There is a church of Bob, a.k.a. the 
Church of the Subgenius; Drugstore Cowboy, which  stars Matt Dillon as a 
junkie named Bob, also features both Heather (Annie) Graham (as Nadine!!) 
and Grace Zabriskie (as Bob's mother!!) in its cast, finally, there 
is Bob Barker, the game-show host who decided to stop dying his hair and 
let it turn naturally white (!!).  Also, in Amherst, Nova Scotia at the
turn of the 19th century, a young girl named Esther Cox was legendary for 
her claims of disturbances by a poltergeist (one that set fire to her barn) 
that she called Bob.

   26. The Little Man From Another Place: In Nicholas Roeg's Don't Look 
Now, Donald Sutherland (grieving over the death of his daughter) pursues a 
malevolent dwarf in a red suit. As well, his wife is named Laura, and the 
movie's film editor, Graeme Clifford, directed an episode of TP (2005)

   27. Venus and Saturn: The statue (presumably of Venus) and the model 
of Saturn in the dream sequence may refer to the myth of Saturn, who killed 
his children. However, Venus was the daughter of Jupiter, not Saturn. It has 
been suggested (by RJG) that BOB=Saturn=bad god, Leland=Jupiter=good god, 
Laura=Venus=daughter of good god. Also, BOB refers to his victim's as his 
children, therefore making  "Jupiter",the son of "Saturn" as well as the 
father of "Venus"

   28. Talking backwards: apparently a talent known to Michael 
Anderson, which was apprently taught to the rest of the actors in the red 
room scenes. 

   29. The floor in the dream sequence was seen in Eraserhead.The red
drapes are reminiscent of the red curtains used in the titles to the biblical 
epic movie The Robe. This may have also inspired the blue velvet curtains 
used in the opening titles of Blue Velvet.

(From 1003)
   
   30.  Madeleine Ferguson: A reference to Vertigo, in which Judy (Kim Novak) 
posed as the "dead" Madeleine. As well, Jimmy Stewart's character was named 
Scottie Ferguson, giving Madeleine her surname. In Vertigo, Scottie makes Judy 
dye her hair blonde to look like Madeleine, a la James making Maddy up like 
Laura to catch the killer.)  One scene in this movie, in which Scottie is
momentarily confused as to whether he is with Judy or Madeleine, shows this by 
having the room spin around them as they embrace, as with Leland/BOB's death 
hold on Maddy.The other, fairly _obvious_ reference is probably the only 
instance of "identical cousins", namely the main characters from "The Patty Duke
 Show".


   31. "Johnny doesn't know what day it is": A reference, no doubt, to the 
Who's epic "Tommy". Perhaps written in anticipation of a storyline where 
Johnny is revealed as a savant? 

   32. The Bookhouse: There's a posssible connection with a native god 
named Bukwus or Bukus(RJG), or even the Roman god Bacchus (JP).If anybody 
has anything more to add, please give me a shout.

   33. The dream soul: has anybody with a knowledge of Blackfoot 
culture been able to trace this legend? I'm not doubting its existence, but 
would like to know more. 

(From 1004)
   
   34. Jacoby's sunglasses: Count Floyd on SCTV sported Ray-Ban 
Wayfarer versions of the same glasses, suitable for 3-D viewing. However,
3-D glasses are Blue-Red, while Jacoby's glasses are Red-Blue. Perhaps the
Dr. can "see deeper" into people with his glasses on.

   35. Gordon Cole: A minor character in BIlly Wilder's Sunset 
Boulevard, one of David Lynch's all-time favourite movies. (CN and DGP)

    36. Phillip Michael Gerard: See note # 12.

   37. Bob Lydecker: See note #4.

   38. Waldo: See note #4. Also, "The Avengers" had an episode that hinged 
on a talking bird or group of talking birds.

   39. Hank's Domino: I'm not sure about this one; any suggestions? 

   40. Owls: The first sighting of an owl in TP was in 1004, when Donna 
and James went to where they had buried the necklace. An owl hooted above, 
startling the two. There have been brief mentions in this newsgroup of the 
fact that according to Whitley Streiber's "Communion", the experience of being 
abducted by aliens (or whatever) is often erased by the "covering" memory 
of a giant owl.


(From 1005)

   41. ITL: While Hank reunites with Norma, Shelly is watching ITL. 
Montana is attacking Chet, and Jared is tied up  with a blue sash in his 
mouth, a la Blue Velvet.

   42. "The Third Man": A possible reference to the movie The Third Man, 
in which the "third man" (seen carrying off a dead body) turns out to be the 
"victim" himself, thus causing some to believe that Laura was not really 
dead, and disguised as Maddy.

   43. "Into The Night": See note #19.

(From 1006)

   44. Cooper's whistling: The tune Cooper blows on his whistle is the flying 
saucer's tone in Close Encounters Of The Third Kind. Possible foreshadowing of 
the alien stuff?

   45. Audrey spying on Battis through the slats in the closet door: Kyle 
MacLachlan did the same thing in Blue Velvet.

   
   46. Mr. Neff (Catherine Martell's insurance salesman): A reference to 
Walter Neff, an insurance salesman in Billy Wilder's RDouble IndemnityS. 
(CN)

   47. Barney and Fred (Coop and Ed's secret IDs): 'nuff said.

   48. Hester Prynn: As Blackie notes, the woman in "The Scarlet Letter".
   
   49. The cherry stem: TP writer Harley Peyton once claimed that his 
ex-girlfriend could actually do this.
    
(From 1007)

   50. Queen of Diamonds: The card that triggered Raymond Shaw 
(Laurence Harvey) to kill in The Manchurian candidate. At one point, Rosie 
(Janet Leigh) wore a large version of the card at a costume party. 

   51. "Such stuff as dreams are made of": More Shakespeare,from The Tempest,
Ac IV, Sc I, line 155. The speaker, Prospero, has just presented a play in which all the
actors were spirits (which he had the power to command) and he had become so
caught up in it that he almost forgot that some spirits were plotting to kill
him. He tells the spirit actors to disperse and makes a very famous speech in 
which he says that, just as the spirits disappear, so is human life and all the
world transitory. It goes on very poetically for a number of lines and ends
with: "We are such stuff as dreams are made on; and our little life is rounded
with a sleep." (BM) Actually, this is much more lyrical than its actual use in 
Twin Peaks: the speaker is Ben Horne, just before his tryst with the "new girl".
Just another sign of Horne's pretensiousness, I guess (DGP).

   52."Who Shot Agent Cooper?": Mark Frost has been quoted as saying 
"We were poking a little bit of fun at the 'Who shot J.R.' syndrome. Of course, 
he's wearing a bulletproof vest. I wasn't trying to present a mystery."

SEASON TWO

(from 2001) 

   53. The Waiter (a.k.a. Senor Droolcup): Another example of Lynch's 
tendency towards long, drawn-out, slooooow scenes. The Dell Mibbler scene 
is far more excruciating example of this, as noted by many 
netters. These scenes are especially agonizing at the tensest cliff-hanger 
moments, like right here.
   
   54. The Giant: Not entirely sure. Giants are common in most 
mythologies, but does anybody know the exact source of this giant?  Lynch 
himself said that Carel Struycken was cast as the Giant just because he saw 
him one day (DP). My own theory is that since Michael Anderson, the actor 
who plays the LMFAP, was in jail for drug posession at the time of the 
filming of 2000, the Giant was cast to replace him (DGP). However, I have 
been wrong before.

   55. "A man in a smiling bag": A product of Lynch's days in Philadelphia, 
where he lived near a morgue. 

   56. The reporter at the site of the burnt sawmill is Mark Frost in an 
uncredited role.

   57. Leland's white hair: See note #25.

(From 2002)

   58. When Shelly and Bobby are parked in Major Briggs' Lincoln, the 
"Audrey's Dance" music is playing. Bobby tells Shelly to change the station, 
and the music abruptly stops, switching to a blues song. A similar trick was 
used in 1001, and may be a cinematic allusion to Diva (1982), where the 
"incidental" music became part of the foreground action.

   59. Major Briggs' space transmissions: A few may recall the series 
Project: UFO from the late '70s (around the time of Close Encounters), which 
I believe was based on Project Bluebook.

   60. "Just You And I": an article in British GQ suggested that TP is an 
attempt to combine every TV series from the past. In that case, James' song 
near the end of the show may be an homage to Rick Nelson's songs at the end 
of the Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. Or maybe not.

(From 2003)
   
   61. "She's ready for her close-up now": A paraphrasing of 
Gloria Swanson's most famous line in "Sunset Boulevard" (see note #35): 
"I'm ready for my close-up now, Mr. DeMille." (CN)

(From 2004)

   62. Judge Sternwood: The character who hires Philip Marlowe in "The 
Big Sleep" is named General Sternwood (CN).
   
   63. Darryl Lodwick: An overzealous prosecutor in "Anatomy of A 
Murder" is named Mitchell Lodwick.

(From 2005) 

   64. Mr. Racine (Leo's Lawyer): A reference to Lawrence Kasdan's "Body 
Heat" in which William Hurt plays a seedy lawyer in a movie inspired by 
"Double Indemnity" (See note #46) (CN). (Also,  Racine -in TP- is played by 
Van Dyke Parks, the avante-garde composer-arranger who worked with 
Beach Boy Brian Wilson (DGP))

(From 2006) 

   65. "Getting To Know You": Rodgers and Hammerstein, from "The King 
And I" 

(From 2007)

   66. "Rockin' Back Inside My Heart"/"The World Spins": See note # 19.

   67. The White Horse: Death, or Heroin, for sure, but probably not Troy, 
Laura Palmer's pony. According to the secret diary, Troy was brown or reddish-
brown.

(From 2008)

   68. "Surrey With The Fringe On Top": More Rodgers and Hammerstein, 
this time from "Oklahoma!"
   
(From 2009)
   
   69. "Leland, the time has come for you to seek the path.": The "clear 
light" is  constantly referred to as the first step in the ascension to a life-
after-death, and is common to many religions. However, the "void and 
cloudless sky" seems to be from the Tibetan Book Of The Dead.

   70. "There's more in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of in 
our philosphy": Hamlet (ac I:sc V, lines 166-167) in response to the 
discovery of his father's ghost. In this case, Cooper might not be the Hamlet,
but Truman is definitely the bewildered Horatio.

(From 2010)

   71. "Waldorf Salad": This may be stretching a bit, but I honestly 
believe this is a reference (as before; see note #16) to Fawlty Towers, 
which based a whole episode on Basil not knowing what this was.

   72. Mountie King: King was the name of Sergeant Preston's dog. 

   73. The White Lodge: I am grateful to Jerry Boyajian 
for the explanation of the White Lodge. Apparently, in "The Devil's Guard" 
(a.k.a. "Ramsden") (by Talbot Mundy?), the White Lodge is a secret order that 
tries to create good, of which the Dalai Lama is a member. (I am also grateful 
to Janet M. Swisher for printing this fact in "Twin Peaks Frequently Answered 
Questions").

(From 2011)

   74. The Black Lodge/"The Dweller On The Threshold": When I first saw 
this episode, I immediately thought of the "Mirror, Mirror" episode of Star 
Trek. In keeping with the theory that TP=every bit of pop culture ever made 
(see note #60), and given Cooper's pure goodness, an "evil Cooper" sequence 
was inevitable.

   75. Roger Hardy at the RR: The only purpose of this scene is, of course, 
a MOD SQUAD REUNION!!! (sort of; apparently Michael Cole wasn't available 
for Mountie King or some other such role).   Not a true reference, but I wanted 
to mention it.

   76. James and Evelyn Marsh: I don't know what other people on the 
network thought of this arc (most probably hated it), but I liked it, in a 
strange way.  To my mind, the sequence resembled nothing so much as a 
James Dean movie, thus bringing James' character to its logical fruition. The 
dialogue in these scenes ("It's not the bike, it's just where it can take me... 
Sometimes I just go down the highway blind"-Loved it! pure camp.) seemed 
stilted and contrived on purpose. The existentially-depressed-James may 
have gotten a little annoying, but I thought it wasn't nearly as bad as some 
people did.

   77. "Now is the winter of our discontent...": The first lines from 
Shakespeare's Richard III, which certainly aptly describes Ben's situation.

(From 2012)
   
   78. Nicky-as-the-devil: (see note #60) In this case, "The Omen."

   79."O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! It seems she..." Romeo
and Juliet, Ac I: Sc V, lines 46-49.

(From 2013)

   80. The Mark: Major Briggs' tattoo resembles (as many have pointed 
out) a variation on the radiation symbol.

   81. Spaceships and Owls: See note #40.

   82. "The Dorritt Home For Boys": The Dickensian nature of the "Little 
Nicky" plot (Orphans, lost lineage,the revelation of hidden origins, 
misfortune and serendipity in general) naturally calls for a suitably 
Dickensian name for the orphanage. 

   83. Ben's Civil War fantasy: Dr. Jacoby's explanation of Ben's delusion 
(re-enacting a failure to fight against his own inadeqacies) seems plausible, 
but why the Civil War? Ben had never before shown any sign of being a Civil 
War buff (as well, doesn't it seem especially strange that the owner of the 
*Great Northern* would identify with the South? -just kidding). However, 
one could see how Ben -a cocky, no-holds-barred maverick- could see some 
of himself in the Confederates (although not neccesarily Robert E. Lee). Of 
other interest is that immediately after Ben's fantasy ends, he is "rescued" 
by John Justice Wheeler -a possible reference to a Confederate cavalry 
general named Joseph Wheeler. As well,  Frost and Lynch's interest in the 
Civil War may  have been piqued by the PBS series (DGP). Another probable TP
connection is the war between Ben (the South) and Jean Renault (the North), who
has taken over OEJs. (RH)

(From 2014)

   84. "Wine comes in at the mouth": Yeats, as Pete notes. Although
Pete uses it because it's the only toast he knows (other than a limerick), the 
connection with Yeats suggests Pete's possible spiritual (indeed, mystical) 
nature, which has only rarely been touched upon.   

   85. The Black Pawn (No.1): The chess references  brought to my mind 
not Alice In Wonderland or somesuch, but The Avengers, both for the 
chessboard opening and an episode in which people were dispatched in ways 
that were made to resemble board games, e.g. a man killed by snakebite 
after climbing a ladder- Snakes and Ladders. Actually, the giant Pawn is a 
better example of this.      
 
(From 2015)

    86. The bus drivers listening to opera: A possible Ralph Kramden 
reference? I thought that this episode of TP (directed by Diane Keaton) had 
some bad lapses in TP's sensibility. There were times (the above scene and 
the deputies leaving the Marshes in strict formation) where Keaton did stuff 
purely for style. In the other episodes, the "strange" or stylized elements in 
scenes (the dwarf, the spotlights, BOB, the Giant) were "explained", not just 
there for show. Does anybody else agree?
   
   87. The wooden wind instrument that We is always playing and "wacking"
folks with is reminiscent of Kung Fu -- David Carradine (Caine) did similar 
things with his flute and his other personal articles in that series, no? 
(LDZ)

   88. Springfield: Earle's first target (to form the "C" -for "Cooper" or 
"Caroline") is Homer Simpson's hometown.

(From 2016)

   89. John Justice Wheeler: See note #83. Also, there is a John Wheeler 
who was a proponent of the multiple universes interpretation of Quantum Theory.

   90. "See the mountains kiss high heaven", etc.: Shelley, from "Love's 
Philosophy", Verse II. What makes me wonder is that the poem doesn't seem 
like something Coop would chose. Maybe he is more romantic than I thought, 
although my impression from both the show and the Autobiography is that 
Coop is not someone as interested in poetry (after all, he got a C from April) 
as he is in arcana and mysteries.

(From 2017)

   91. Margaret's Mark: The tattoo on the Log Lady is, IMHO, the Twin Peaks.

   92. Dr. Craig: A possible nudge at St. Elsewhere?
   
   93. Miss Twin Peaks: "On the set of the pilot, the makeup artist 
always called me Miss Twin Peaks. 'C'mere, Miss Twin Peaks!'": Sherilyn Fenn 
from "Babes In The Woods" (the "Women Of Twin Peaks" article in Rolling 
Stone, October 4, 1990).  Of course, Audrey ends up being the most reluctant 
to enter the contest.

(From 2018)

     94. Spelunking: In the obligatory TP sketch during the Kyle 
MachLachlan episode of Saturday Night Live, Coop described to Truman a dream in 
which a hairless mouse sang a songs about caves, and Coop said "Harry, tonight 
we're going to do a little spelunking." This CAN'T be a coincidence!

(From 2019)

   95. The Black Pawn (No. 2) See note # 85.

(From 2020) 

   96. The Dugpas: The dugpas were mentioned in "The Devil's Guard (aka
Ramsden)" Briefly, there was a sect of Tibetan buddhism called Dugpas that 
were black magicians. Sexual excesses and murder were two characteristics of 
their practise. Their chief opponents were the sect headed by the Dalai Lama.

   97. "When Jupiter and Saturn meet, they will receive you": Most people 
now take this to be an astronomical/astrological reference, as Cooper later 
deduces.

   98. "When Jupiter and Saturn meet, Oh what a crop of mummy wheat": 
Yeats, who was _very_ interested in the occult, mythology, and good and 
evil. In the Roman system of gods, Jupiter (good), as shown before, was the 
son of Saturn (evil), and symbolizes the duel between Leland and Bob, as 
well as Cooper and BOB. another thing to note is that Yeats' "gyres" (the two 
spirals representing the two natures of mankind and nature) resemble twin peaks. 
Yeats' take on mythology  informs much of the last episode, and may explain the 
cyclical nature of life in Twin Peaks.

   99. Miss Twin Peaks/The Taking Of The Queen: As a netter mentioned 
(please write with your name so you can be credited properly!) the floor at 
the roadhouse in the contest scenes resmbles a chess- or checker-board.

   100. Glastonberry Grove: The coincidental name shared with the 
legendary burial place of King Arthur (sort of: It's really Glastonbury) has 
had many run off in search of possible Fisher-King connections. I wonder... 
Most have proven a little tenuous, although some connections have been 
made: Andy seems to be set up as a Parsifal archetype (DGP). A good analogy
is WE::King Arthur, Caroline/Annie::Guinivere, Coop::SIr Lancelot (RH)
My own personal knowledge of Arthurian legend only goes as far as the Howard 
Pyle illustrated children's books and "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", but I 
_do_ like the idea of the cup-of-coffee-as-holy grail. The idea of "a child 
without a father" suggests to me Donna, or Lucy's baby, or even Little Nicky 
(he has to serve *some* purpose!). If anyone has more to add, please enter 
it.(DGP)

   101. The circle of sycamore trees: In the Tibetan book Of The Dead, 
according to Joseph Campbell, sycamore trees are connected with the Egyptian 
(Heliopolitan?) goddess Nut. As well, the twelve-trees/twelve-candles (twelve 
rooms?) connection is well noted. The circle was a sacred symbol in the 
religion of the druids (see note #17).

   102. The bank vault and Dell: See note #53.

   103. Chained Audrey: Another Avengers reference? (See note #85) (It 
seems to me that Emma Peel ended up shackled to objects quite a bit.)

"the gal with no arms. The name was Milo": GC in 2018. 
   
   105. "Doppelganger": It seemed to me to be a squaredance call, sort of 
like "change partners." "Doppelgaenger" has been translated from the German 
"Doppel" -Double-"Gaenger"-Goer. This has been interpreted as meaning both 
a shape-changer or a true double - a negative image of oneself that will 
destroy its counterpart - a la antimatter. This certainly agrees with the 
"imperfect courage" that Hawk mentioned. However, I see the doppelgangers as 
being both -- the Caroline-Annie-Shadow-Laura wraith could have all been Windom 
Earle, but the Shadow-Cooper (Doppelcooper?) was definitely a negative image of 
Cooper. Personally, I still think that this was the inevitable 
reference/homage/parody of "Mirror, Mirror" (See notes # 60 & #74).(DGP)  One 
definition of doppelgaenger (and the earliest on record) is "one who has seen
himself". Such an experience was taken as an ill omen, namely one of impending 
death.(RH)


   106. On the subject of classical allegories, how come 
noone (except the Toronto Globe and Mail) has mentioned "Faust"? Dale gave up 
his soul, right? For Annie, right? Sounds like a bargain with Mephistopheles 
to me. My personal knowledge of Faust gave me the impression that Faust made his
deal with the devil for the love a woman. (DGP) However, BM disagrees, although
she admits that Windom Earle was trying to play Mephistopheles, and was punished
gravely for his overstepping of bounds.

   107. "How's Annie?": The ending was, of course, guessed to a 
reasonable degree, by netter Daniel Mittleman, who should probably get 
some kind of award.

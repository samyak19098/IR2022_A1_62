=============
A British comedian and an actor, he became famous co-starring with Rik Mayall
in The Young Ones, a hit BBC cult sitcom. Since then, he's starred in Bottom, and occasionally pops up in Absolutely Fabulous as a food reviewer.

2. So, what about his life before hitting the big time?

He was born on January 24 1957 in Bradford (I think...) His father taught
abroad for the Armed Forces, and he lived with his father until the age of
12. He then entered Pocklington Public (i.e. privately-funded) boarding
school, and went off to Manchester University to study Drama. He was in the
same year as Rik Mayall, and eventually got a 2-1 (equivalent to a 'B')...

3. How did he hit the big time?

Well, I now hand you over to a press release:

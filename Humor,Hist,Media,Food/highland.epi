Highlander Episode Guide -- Season 1

Now that the first season is over, and our immortal friends won't
be back for several months, here is the final copy of the episode
guide for the whole season.

May contain SPOILERS for the most recent episodes, but if you haven't
seen them by now, tough luck.

Coming next season... the Highlander Episode Guide, Extended Version!
More on the plot of each episode!  Quotes!  Trivia!  Dancing bears!
The station list!

ok, no dancing bears.  but if all you Highlander fans out there send
me your favorite quotes, I can include them in the Extended Guide.
Even if you just paraphrase them and tell me which episode they occur
in, I'll track them down... after I get my tapes back from everyone 
who has borrowed them, including my worthless friend who didn't 
return seven episodes before he moved to LA!!!

On the station list, it is not included in this posting.  I'll
continue to post it every couple of weeks and hope to get some more
feedback so by the time the new season rolls around, we will have
coverage of most of the USA.

And now, without further ado, the final version of the First Season
of the...

ALFRED HITCHCOCK'S CAMEO APPEARANCES

This is not a complete filmography, but was posted a while ago. It is
a list of all of Hitch's appearences in his films (a famous trademark).
I think a complete filmography might be in the Hitchcock/Truffaut
book but I'm not sure.

Alfred Hitchcock appeared in 31 of his movies.  Below is a summary of
where to find him in these films.  If you don't want to know where he
appears and want to guess or look for him, then save but DON'T LOOK!!

This is taken from PREMIERE magazine, April 1988 (Short Takes, "Brief 
Encounters", pg. 11), by Don Lipper:


BLACKMAIL (1929):  Being bothered by a small boy as he reads a book in 
the subway.

Mannheim run from the theater, seven minutes into the movie.

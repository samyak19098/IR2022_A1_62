 I've seen it stated in several sources that he only appeared in all of his 
 movies from THE LODGER (1926) onwards, so he definitely doesn't appear in:
THE PLEASURE GARDEN (1925)
THE MOUNTAIN EAGLE (1926)
 However, the following movies (mostly early British ones) are missing from
 the above list:
Champagne
Downhill
Farmer's Wife, The
Jamaica Inn (1939)
Juno and Paycock
Man Who Knew Too Much, The (1934)
Manxman, The
Number Seventeen
Rich and Strange
Ring, The (1927)
Sabotage
Secret Agent
Skin Game, The (1931)
Suspicion (1941)
Waltzes from Vienna

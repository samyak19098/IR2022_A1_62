First some examples:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Lethal Weapon 3
- During the credits you can hear that another bomb has been discovered. When
  Martin and Roger show up in their car, they have this discussion again
  whether or not to go in. Just as they stop at the building, the whole
  building explodes and you can hear Martin saying, while backing up the car,
  "I hope nobody saw us".

# Masters of the Universe
- Skeltor says "I'll be back!".

# Singles
- Outtakes after credits on video version
- Steve (Campbell Scott) goes to a house looking for Linda (Kyra Sedgwick), but
  a woman at the house (Debbie Mazar) tells him that she's moved out to live
  with some guy.
- Steve walks down the street past the mime (Eric Stoltz) to the magazine stand
  where the magazines on the rack start talking to him, giving him advice.  He
  goes home to his apartment.
- David (Jim True) walks down a street.  His voiceover says that Steve's search
  for the perfect girl is a trap, and that he lives his own life like a French
  movie where everyone is cool and no attachments are made.  He enters a
  beatnik club where a woman (Lara Harris) recites a poem in French.  She sits
  down with him for a brief conversation in French and they leave together.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# <Movie Name>

    Damon Gillian's wardrobe by Chez Antoine, 19th century
  craftsmanship for the 21st century man.
    Cadre trooper and studio guard's sidearms provided by Colt
  Chester, the pistol of patriots.
    Remember, tickets for the ICS studio tour are always available
  for class A citizens in good standing.

  affiliate, and then go out and do something really despicable!
    I'm Bill Hilgen. Good night and take care!"

- The makers of this motion picture consumed mass quantities
  of pizza, orange juice and water during the production. They
  never used drugs and have no intention of doing so in the future.
  Say "no" to drugs and have a long and happy life. Unless,
  of course, you are run over by an RTD driver, in which case
  you will have a short but happy life.
- Any similarity between asses portrayed in this motion picture
  and real asses, living or dead, are purely coincidental.
- The Producers would like to assure that no animals were injured
  in the making of this motion picture. Unfortunately, the same
  cannot be said of some of our actors.
- But seriously, folks...
  Any unauthorized duplication, distribution and exploitation
  of this motion picture will result in criminal prosecution
  and for all you video pirates out there, that means get your
  hands off our movie or we'll come after you with a loaded gun.
- When in California, visit the Omega Studios. The tour lasts
  only 30 seconds and is cheap, especially for blondes over
  5 ft. 8 in. with blue eyes, who may win an intimate dinner
  for two with the producer of this motion picture.

-       [Fade in to Wayne and Garth on their couch looking at magazines]
        Garth: "You know, I don't think anyone's going to tell us when to
                leave."
        Wayne: "Yeah, good call Garth.  Uh, I bet we're just going to sit
                here and when they're finished they'll fade to black."
        [Fade to black]

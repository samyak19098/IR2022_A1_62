      The Recipe !! 
             
 
            Mix 2,400 grams of sugar with just enough water to dissolve
     (high-frutcose corn syrup may be substituted for half the sugar.)
     Add 37 grams of carmel, 3.1 grams caffeine, and 11 grams of phosphoric
     acid. Extract Cocaine from 1.1 grams of coca leaf (Truxillo growth of
     coca preferred ) with toluol; (at this point you are supposed to discard
     the cocaine extract. The author takes No resposibility for what ever
     people do with the cocaine!!!) Soak the coca leaves and kola nuts
     (both finely powdered; 0.37 gram of kola nuts) in 22 grams of 20%
     alcohol. California white wine fortified to 20% strength was used as the 
     soaking soulution circa 1909, But Coca-Cola may have switched to a simple
     water/alcohol mixture. After soaking, discard the coca and the kola and
     add the liquid to the syrup. Add 30 grams of lime juice to that. Now
     Mix together 0.88 gram of lemon oil, 0.47 gram of Orange oil, 0.27 gram
     of lime oil, 0.20 gram of cassia (Chinese cinnamon) oil, 0.07 gram of 
     nutmeg oil, and if desired,traces of coriander, lavender, neroli oils,
     and add to 4.9 grams of 95% alcohol. Shake. Add 2.7 grams of water to
     the alcohol/oil mixture and let stand 24 hours at about 60^degrees F.
     A Cloudy layer will seperate. Take off the Clear part of the liquid only 
     and addto the syrup. Add 19 grams of glycerin (from vegteable sources,
     not hog fat, so the drink can be sold to Orthadox Jews & Moslems) and
    add 1.5 Grams of vanilla extract. Add water (Treated with chlorine) 
   to make 1 Gallon of syrup. 
 
         Yield: 128 6.5 ounces bottles (serve with flavored Carbonated water)

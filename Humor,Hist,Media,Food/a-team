			The A-Team Episode Guide


Ten years ago/In 1972, a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military
court for a crime they didn't commit.  These men promptly escaped a maximum
security stockade to the Los Angeles underground.  Today, still wanted by the
government, they survive as soldiers of fortune.  If you have a problem, if no
one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the A-Team.

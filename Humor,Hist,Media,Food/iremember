i remember those days.

i was into things. i listened to Inf. Soc. and kmfdm. i sat in a dirty
corner at my fathers house on my leading edge 286, with those awful 5.25"
drives, one with dos, one with procomm plus, plotting ways to reconnect to
the same line after my 60 minute freenet session was over.

i remember those awful freenet picnics, where some of the peoples skin was
paler than the plain white t-shirts i used to wear all the time. the
cliques, the loners, the fact that we all knew  ourselves as ap035 and
sa131 and cl762.

1200 baud. warez boards that let you in if you knew what InC and ACiD
stood for. hacking irc. social engineering accounts from people you hated,
or better yet, taking the other phone and calling them, because their
mommy and daddy didn't want the call waiting turned off. wondering
if my cpu would crash, because the buffer might overload while i was
capturing uuencoded porn.  the green trench coat that lasted me through
high school.

then there were the text files.

everything i learned about making my own drugs, picking locks, exploiting
unix and bestiality i learned on searchlight boards, wildcat hacks and
usenet, when people actually had something useful to say.

those days are gone. like most of the other kids that were around during
that era, i got a real job in computers, and although i still sit in front
of this damned box all night long when the  girl's at school, it's not the
same. freenet's gone in cleveland. the people i used to look forward to
chatting with at 3 am have moved on, some for better, some for worse, some
for AOL.

don't get me wrong, everyone deserves an IPO, right? cheers for linux and
rob malda and jon katz. props to search engines and al4a. palm pilots and
G4's and transmeta are alright in my book.  but they'll never replace the
fondness i have for CGA graphics and copycon autoexec.bat.

so here's to all of us that read CdC when it was new, to people who
actually knew what a SysOp was and definitely to anyone that had a
TI-994a.

one of these days i'm going to pull that 286 out of the attic and write
text files on it. maybe somebody will know what the hell i'm talking
about.

   BEER: THE PREFERRED DRINK OF MOST
TEENAGERS. MOST PEOPLE FIND IT BORING
WHEN ALL THEY HAVE TO DO AT A PARTY IS
SIT AROUND AND JUST DRINK. TO PASS THE
TIME, HAVE A FEW GOOD LAUGHS, AND MAKE
THE STUFF GO DOWN EASIER, PEOPLE
INVENTED GAMES TO PLAY WITH DRINKING
BEER.

QUARTERS
********
 
   THIS IS PROBABLY THE MOST OFTEN AND
POPULAR GAME AROUND. IT IS RATHER
SIMPLE. GET A CASE OR SO (DEPENDING ON
HOW LONG YOU WANT TO PLAY AND HOW DRUNK

MUCH BEER YOU NEED) AND A SMALL TO
MEDIUM SIZED GLASS NO MORE THAN 3-5
INCHES HIGH, AND A QUARTER (ANY YEAR).
THE BEST WAY TO PLAY IS WITH 5-7 PEOPLE
AND NOT ALL GUYS!
   FILL THE GLASS AS MUCH AS YOU WANT
WITH BEER AND YOU'RE OFF! THE OBJECT OF
THE GAME IS TO GET THE QUARTER INTO THE
GLASS (THIS IS HARDER THAN IT SOUNDS).
TO GET THE QUARTER INTO THE GLASS YOU
BOUNCE IT OFF THE TABLE. THE BEST WAY
IS TO PUT THE GLASS ABOUT 6 INCHES AWAY
FROM WHERE THE QUARTER WILL BOUNCE.
   AFTER YOU GET THE QUARTER INTO THE
GLASS, GIVE THE GLASS TO SOMEONE TO
GUZZLE (ONLY COOL PEOPLE DRINK THE
QUARTER WITH THE BEER AND SPIT OUT THE
QUARTER!). IF A PERSON GETS THE QUARTER
IN ON A MULTIPLE OF 3 (IE: 3,6,9...) HE
MUST DRINK.
   WE PLAY WITH A FEW VARIATIONS THAT
YOU MAY ENJOY. ONE TRICK THAT IS ALWAYS
A KILLER IS AFTER THE PERSON GETS THE
QUARTER INTO THE GLASS, HE MUST POINT
WITH HIS ELBOW TO THE PERSON HE WISHES
TO DRINK. IF HE FAILS TO DO SO THEN HE
MUST DRINK.
   ANOTHER VARIATION IS WHAT WE CALL
"CHANCE IT". WHEN A PERSON "CHANCES IT"
IT IS WHEN HE MISSES HIS SHOT AND
WISHES TO TRY AGAIN. THE GLASS IS THEN
FILLED UP A LITTLE MORE WITH BEER AND
THE PERSON GETS ANOTHER CHANCE. IF HE
MISSES AGAIN, HE MUST DRINK.
   MY PERSONAL VIEW ON THIS ONE IS
UNLESS YOU PLAY WITH SOME PEOPLE THAT
ARE REALLY HILARIOUS, THE GAME BECOMES
RATHER BORING. ONE OTHER THING I FORGOT
TO MENTION WAS (THIS IS CRUEL) IS

TO GANG UP ON ONE PERSON, SO WHEN YOU
START GETTING THE QUARTERS IN, THAT
PERSON DRINKS ALL OF THEM...HAVE FUN!

THUMPER
*******
 
   THUMPER IS MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE
DRINKING GAME. THUMPER IS RATHER
SIMPLE, EACH PERSON HAS A SIGN (IE:
MIDDLE FINGER, PEACE SIGN, ETC) AND ONE
PERSON STARTS BY SHOWING HIS SIGN AND
THEN DOING SOMEONE ELSES SIGN. FOR
EXAMPLE, LET'S SAY MY SIGN IS HOLDING
UP MY MIDDLE INDEX FINGER (IE: THE
"FUCK-YOU" FINGER) AND ANOTHER GUY'S
SIGN IS THE PEACE SIGN. I SHOW MY SIGN
AND THEN THE PEACE SIGN. THE GUY WITH
THE PEACE SIGN GIVES HIS SIGN THEN
SOMEONE ELSES.
   IF A PERSON FUCKS UP, HE MUST DRINK
THE AMOUNT OF BEER THAT WAS POURED INTO
THE GLASS. A PERSON FUCKS UP IF HE
GIVES A WRONG SIGN, TAKES TOO LONG TO
SHOW SOMEONE ELSE'S SIGN, MESSES UP
SOMEONE'S SIGN, OR JUST DIDN'T PAY
ATTENTION WHEN SOMEONE DID HIS SIGN.
   AFTER HALF AN HOUR OR MORE THE GAME
REALLY STARTS TO GET FUN. PEOPLE ARE
GETTING KINDA BUZZED AND START FUCKING
UP MORE AND MORE. THE BEST WAY TO PLAY
THIS IS WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS
POSSIBLE. EACH PERSON SHOULD HAVE A
UNIQUE AND HARD TO REPRODUCE SIGN.
   PERSONALLY I THINK THIS IS ONE OF
THE BEST GAMES AROUND. IF YOU GET THE
RIGHT PEOPLE YOU CAN HAVE ONE HELLUVA

FINGERS LIKE THE LETTER V (PEACE SIGN)
AND STICKING YOUR TONGUE BETWEEN THE
TWO FINGERS. ENJOY!

HI BOB!
*******
 
   THIS GAME IS RATHER INTERESTING.
DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THE OLD BOB
NEWHART SHOW? IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD
SHOW. IN EVERY SHOW SOMEONE ALWAYS
SAYS "HI BOB" TO BOB. IT HAPPENS QUITE
OFTEN WITHIN THE SHOW.
   GET A BUNCH OF PEOPLE AND SIT AROUND
AND PUT ON THE BOB NEWHART SHOW. EVERY
TIME SOMEONE SAYS "HI BOB!", EVERYBODY
DRINKS.
   YOU CAN DO THIS WITH OTHER TV SHOWS,
LIKE ALL IN THE FAMILY (THE OLD
VERSIONS). EVERY TIME ARCHIE SAYS "HEY
MEATHEAD" (OR JUST MEATHEAD) EVERYBODY
DRINKS.
   ALL IN ALL, NOT A BAD GAME...ENJOY!

FLOWER
******
 
   THIS IS ONE OF THE NEWER GAMES THAT
I HAVE LEARNED. IT HAS TURNED OUT TO BE
ONE OF THE BETTER ONES ALSO. TO PLAY
THE GAME YOU WILL NEED ABOUT 6-8
PEOPLE, A GLASS FOR EACH ONE (THE SAME
TYPE OF GLASS FOR EACH ONE WOULD BE THE
BEST), AND A SHITLOAD OF BEER. THE
GLASSES SHOULD BE ABOUT 3-5 INCHES HIGH

TABLE THAT WILL ALLOW A QUARTER TO
BOUNCE. OH YEAH, YOU NEED A QUARTER
TOO.
   ARRANGE THE GLASSES IN A CIRCULAR
PATTERN ON THE TABLE. AFTER THAT IS
DONE, TAKE ANOTHER GLASS AND PUT IT IN
THE CENTER OF THE OTHER GLASSES SO IT
LOOKS LIKE THIS:
 
(O - GLASS)
 
 
                 O
                O O
               O O O
                O O
                 O
 
(DUE TO THE REASON THAT I CANNOT MAKE A
PERFECT CIRCLE, THE FIGURE IS NOT DRAWN
THAT WAY, BUT IN THE GAME MAKE SURE TO
ARRANGE THE GLASSES IN MORE OF A
CIRCLE.). WHEN YOU FINISH ARRANGING THE
GLASSES, FILL EACH ONE HALF-WAY (OR
MORE OR LESS IF YOU WISH) WITH BEER.
FILL THE CENTER GLASS TO ALMOST FULL.
   NEXT, EACH PERSON SITS IN FRONT OF
HIS GLASS. THE GAME BEGINS BY SOMEONE
BOUNCING THE QUARTER INTO ONE OF THE
GLASSES. IF HE MISSES, THE NEXT GUY
GETS A CHANCE AND SO ON UNTIL YOU
DECIDE TO QUIT. IF A PERSON GETS THE
QUARTER IN HIS GLASS (THE ONE HE SHOULD
BE SITTING IN FRONT OF) HE GIVES HIS
GLASS OF BEER TO ANYONE PLAYING TO
DRINK. IF THE QUARTER GOES IN ANY OF
THE OTHER GLASSES, THE PERSON TO WHOM
THAT GLASS BELONGS (IE: THE PERSON
SITTING IN FRONT OF THAT SPECIFIC

   THE REAL EXCITING PART OF THE GAME
OCCURS WHEN SOMEONE BOUNCES THE QUARTER
INTO THE CENTER GLASS. WHEN THIS
HAPPENS EVERYONE GRABS THEIR GLASS AS
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND GUZZLES!!! THE
LAST PERSON TO PUT HIS GLASS DOWN ON
THE TABLE (SIGNIFYING (SP?) THAT HE HAS
FINISHED DRINKING) DRINKS THE BEER IN
THE CENTER GLASS.
   OVERALL, THIS GAME GETS PRETTY
EXCITING, ESPECIALLY IF THE QUARTER
GETS IN THE CENTER GLASS A LOT!! ENJOY!

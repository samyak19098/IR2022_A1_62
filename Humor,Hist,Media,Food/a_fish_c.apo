I tuned into this group because I knew THIS was THE place to ask for the
words to the apology offered by John Cleese while hanging upside-down
from a high window, held by Kevin Klein in the movie, "A Fish Called
Wanda."

Sure enough, not a day or two later, a gent from Australia answered.
Thought I'd share it with you:

G'day Brian,

    Here's the apology scene from a Fish Called Wanda.  (From the script)
-----------------------------
OTTO: You take it back...

	The camera is turning through 180 degrees and now pulls back
	rapidly, to reveal Archie dangling upside down out of the window
	of the flat.  Otto is holding him by his ankles.  The river bed,
	uncovered by water at low tide, is seventy feet below.

ARCHIE: I do.  I offer a complete and utter retraction.  The imputation was
	totally without basis in fact, and was in no way 'fair comment' and
	was motivated purely by malice and I deeply regret any distress that
	my comments may have caused you or your family...

	(People on the bank below are staring up.)

	...And I hereby undertake not to repeat any such slander at any time
	in the future.

OTTO: (hesitates). OK.
-----------------------------

Thanks, Dave!!!  I sure do appreciate it!  I do believe I'm going to try
some "funny business" with my girlfriend this weekend.  Knowing her,
this apology will come in handy.  <grin>

                  Your friend in Lawrence, Massachusetts...
